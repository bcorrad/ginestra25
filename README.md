This repository contains the official PyTorch implementation for the research project GINESTRA: Graph-based embeddINgs for Exploring Secondary-metabolite Taxonomy, Recognition, and Annotation.  The project explores the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for secondary metabolites classification directly from their molecular graphs.
